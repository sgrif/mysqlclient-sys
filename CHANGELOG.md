## [0.4.2] 2024-11-22

## Changed 

* Added support and tests for linking libmariadb on all platforms
* Refactor handling of pregenerated bindings to provide bindings for more platforms out of the box

## [0.3.1] 2024-05-31

### Changed

* Include a notice in the readme that the mysqlclient-src crate is licenced under GPL-v2
* Excluded more files from the mysql source code to minimize the size of mysqlclient-src

## [0.3.0] 2024-05-17

### Added

- We added a `mysqlclient-src` crate and a `bundled` feature for `mysqlclient-sys`. This allows to build and link a static version of libmysqlclient during the rust build process. This feature currently supports targeting Windows, Linux and macOS. It requires a c++ compiler toolchain and cmake to build libmysqlclient from source.
- We added a `buildtime_bindgen` feature flag that allows to generate bindings for your locally installed libmysqlclient version. This is helpful for cases where the target architecture is significantly different to what the built-in bindings assume.


### Changed

- We regenerated the bundled bindings for several libmysqlclient versions. You might now need to set the `MYSQLCLIENT_VERSION` environment to select the matching bindings for your libmysqlclient version
