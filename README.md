mysqlclient-sys
======

Autogenerated Rust bindings for libmysql-client (`#include <mysql.h>`)

Building
--------

For this crate to build, `libmysqlclient` must be installed on your system
(`brew install mysql` on macOS, `apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev` on Ubuntu,
included with the server distribution on Windows). Additionally, either
`pkg-config` or `mysql_config` must be present and able to successfully locate
`libmysqlclient`.

The build script of the crate will attempt to find the lib path of
libmysql-client using the following methods:

- First, it will attempt to use pkg-config to locate it. All the config options,
  such as `PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_CROSS`, `PKG_CONFIG_ALL_STATIC` etc., of the crate
  [pkg-config](https://docs.rs/pkg-config/latest/pkg_config/)
  apply.
- MSVC ABI builds will then check for a [Vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg)
  installation using the [vcpkg cargo build helper](https://docs.rs/vcpkg/latest/vcpkg/).
  Set the `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable to point to your Vcpkg installation and
  run `vcpkg install libmysql:x64-windows` to install the required libraries.
- The library name `mysqlclient` is used unless `MYSQLCLIENT_LIBNAME` environment
  variable is specified.
- If the library cannot be found by using the steps above the build script will 
  check the `MYSQLCLIENT_LIB_DIR` and `MYSQLCLIENT_VERSION` environment variables
- If the library cannot be found using `pkg-config`, it will invoke the command
  `mysql_config --variable=pkglibdir`

The crate will try to use pregenerated bindings for a variety of libmysqlclient versions and supported operating systems.
