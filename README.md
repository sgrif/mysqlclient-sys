mysqlclient-sys
======

Autogenerated Rust bindings for libmysql-client (`#include <mysql.h>`)

Building
--------

For this crate to build, `libmysqlclient` must be installed on your system
(`brew install mysql` on macOS, `apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev` on Ubuntu,
included with the server distribution on Windows). Additionally, either
`pkg-config` or `mysql_config` must be present and able to successfully locate
`libmysqlclient`.

The build script of the crate will attempt to find the lib path of
libmysql-client using the following methods:

- First, it will attempt to use pkg-config to locate it. All the config options,
  such as `PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_CROSS`, `PKG_CONFIG_ALL_STATIC` etc., of the crate
  [pkg-config](http://alexcrichton.com/pkg-config-rs/pkg_config/index.html)
  apply.
- MSVC ABI builds will then check for a [Vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg)
  installation using the [vcpkg cargo build helper](https://github.com/mcgoo/vcpkg-rs).
  Set the `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable to point to your Vcpkg installation and
  run `vcpkg install libmysql:x64-windows` to install the required libraries.
- If the library cannot be found using `pkg-config`, it will invoke the command
  `mysql_config --variable=pkglibdir`

The bindings will be generated against the headers present on your system at
compile time. We will attempt to determine the include directory by using the
output of the first command in this list to return successfully:

- `pkg-config --variable=includedir mysqlclient`
- `mysql_config --variable=pkgincludedir`
